First, play a game of classic Pacman:
->python pacman.py

Now, run the provided ReflexAgent in multiAgents.py:
->python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent

Note that it plays quite poorly even on simple layouts:
->python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic
Inspect its code (in multiAgents.py) and make sure you understand what it's doing.


Files to edit:
-> multiAgents.py	Where all of your multi-agent search agents will reside.
-> pacman.py	The main file that runs Pacman games. This file also describes a Pacman GameState type, which you will use extensively in this project
-> game.py	The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like AgentState, Agent, Direction, and Grid.
-> util.py	Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms.
